# Inertial Calibrate

Calibrating the Inertial Sensor is used to reduce the amount of drift generated by the IQ (2nd generation) Brain's Inertial Sensor.

```cpp
BrainInertial.calibrate();
```

Drifting occurs when the IQ (2nd generation) Brain's Inertial Sensor incorrectly detects movement even though the sensor is not physically moving.

## How To Use

The IQ (2nd generation) Brain's Inertial Sensor must remain still during the calibration process. The calibration process will take approximately 2 seconds to complete.
