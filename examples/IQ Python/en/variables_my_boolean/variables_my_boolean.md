# Boolean Variable

Boolean variables can hold either **True** or **False** values.

## How To Use

To create a boolean variable, create a unique and meaningful variable name. This means that the name of the variable should accurately describe the value that it is storing.

For example, a variable `pressed` should be used to store the value of whether a button is pressed.

Declare this variable with a equal symbol `=` following the Boolean name. Its value can either be `True` or `False`.

## Example

This example assigns a value `True` to a `my_boolean` variable.

```python
my_variable = True
```
