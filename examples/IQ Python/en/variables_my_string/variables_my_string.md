# String Variable

String variables are used to store strings.

## How To Use

To create a string variable, create a meaningful variable name. This means that the variable name should accurately describe its value. 

For example, a variable `name` should be used to store the value of a name.

To assign a string to a string variable, use the `=` operator. It's string value can be enclosed in either `" "` or `' '`.

## Example

This example shows a variable called my_string being assigned the string value `"Hello"`.

```python
my_string = "Hello"
```
