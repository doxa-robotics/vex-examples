# Brain Screen Draw Line
Draws a line on the V5 Brain's screen.

```cpp
Brain.Screen.drawLine(1, 1, 10, 10);
```

## How To Use

The `Brain.Screen.drawLine();` command requires 4 values:

* Value 1: Beginning X coordinate
* Value 2: Beginning Y coordinate
* Value 3: Ending X coordinate
* Value 4: Ending Y coordinate

The line color is determined by the `Brain.Screen.setPenColor();` command. The default line color is white.
