# Drivetrain Turn

Turns the Drivetrain indefinitely.

```cpp
Drivetrain.turn(turnType);
```

## How To Use

The `Drivetrain.turn();` command will rotate the Drivetrain forever, until a new Drivetrain command is used, or the program is stopped.

Use the `left` parameter to turn the Drivetrain to the left.

```cpp
Drivetrain.turn(left);
```

Use the `right` parameter to turn the Drivetrain to the right.

```cpp
Drivetrain.turn(right);
```
