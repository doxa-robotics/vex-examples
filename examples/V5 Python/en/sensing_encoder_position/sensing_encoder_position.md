# Shaft Encoder Position
 
Reports the rotational position of the Shaft Encoder.

```don
encoder.position(UNITS)
```

## How To Use

The `UNITS` parameter accepts either **DEGREES** or **TURNS** as a value.

Position of shaft encoder reports the distance the Shaft Encoder has rotated in integer numbers for degrees, and decimal numbers for turns.
