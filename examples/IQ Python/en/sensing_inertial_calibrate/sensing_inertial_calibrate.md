# Inertial Calibrate

Calibrates a VEX IQ (2nd generation) Brain's Inertial Sensor to reduce the amount of drift generated.

```python
brain_inertial.calibrate()
```

Drifting occurs when the IQ (2nd generation) Brain's Inertial Sensor incorrectly detects movement even though the sensor is not physically moving.

## How To Use

The IQ (2nd generation) Brain's Inertial Sensor must remain still during the calibration process. The calibration process will take approximately 2 seconds to complete.
