# Numeric Variable

Numeric variables are used to store numerical values.

## How To Use

To create a numeric variable, create a meaningful variable name. This means that the variable name should accurately describe the value that it is storing. 

For example, a variable `counter` should be used to store the value of a counter.

To assign a value to the variable, use the `=` operator. 

## Example 1

This example keeps the default variable name `my_number` and assigns it a value of 10.

```python
my_number = 10
```
## Example 2

This example gives the variable the name `three_plus_two` and stores the result of the 3 added to 2. 

```python
three_plus_two = 3 + 2
```
