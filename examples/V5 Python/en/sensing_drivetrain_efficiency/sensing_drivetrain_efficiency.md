```don
drivetrain.efficiency(PERCENT)
```

## How To Use
Drive efficiency reports the value of the power (in watts) the motor is using (input), versus the amount of power (in watts) the motor is providing (output).

A V5 Drivetrain typically reaches a maximum efficiency of **65%** under normal use cases.

Drive efficiency reports a range from **0% to 100%**.
