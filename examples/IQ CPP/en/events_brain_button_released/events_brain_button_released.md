# Brain Button Released

Runs the callback function when the specified VEX IQ Brain button is released.

```cpp
Brain.Button.released(callback);
```

## How To Use

You will need to create a function to call when a Brain Button is released.

```cpp
void buttonReleased() {
  Brain.Screen.print("Button released.");
}
```

The `Brain.Button.released` function can be used with the different buttons on the VEX IQ Brain.

An IQ (1st generation) Brain and IQ (2nd generation) Brain has slightly different button options, but they can be interchangeably used on either Brain generation.

Supported Brain buttons are as follows:
- `buttonUp` / `buttonLeft`
- `buttonDown` / `buttonRight`
- `buttonCheck`

## Callback Functions

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. The code inside the **callback function** will run whenever the **event** occurs. 

```cpp
void callbackFunction() {
  Brain.Screen.print("Callback Function Called.");
}

int main() {
  Brain.Button.released(callbackFunction);
}
```
