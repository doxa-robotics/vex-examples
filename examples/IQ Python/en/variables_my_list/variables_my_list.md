# List Variable

List variables are used to store multiple values.

## How To Use

To create a list variable, create a meaningful variable name. This means that the variable name should accurately describe the nature of its values.

For example, a list variable `colors` can be used to store multiple color values.

To assign a list of values to a list variable, use the `=` operator, followed by comma-separated values enclosed in a set of square brackets, `[ ]`.

If the values are numbers, the separating commas should come right after each value.

`my_number_list = [1, 2, 3]`

If the values are strings, the commas should go outside of the `" "`.

`my_string_list = ["Hello", "World"]`

To access a specific value in the list variable, enter the name of the list variable, immediately followed by an index enclosed by a set of square brackets. Keep in mind that the index of an array starts at 0, not 1.

For example, `my_string_list[0]` will return the value `"Hello"`.

## Example 1

This example shows a variable called my_list being assigned the string values of several colors.

```python
my_list = ["Green", "Red", "Blue"]
```

## Example 2

This example shows a variable called my_list being assigned several numbers.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```
