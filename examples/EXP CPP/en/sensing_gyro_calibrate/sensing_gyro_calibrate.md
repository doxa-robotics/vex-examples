# Gyro Calibrate

Calibrating the Gyro Sensor is used to reduce the amount of drift generated by Gyro Sensor.

```cpp
Gyro.calibrate();
```

Drifting occurs when the Gyro Sensor incorrectly detects movement even though the sensor is not moving.

## How To Use

The Gyro Sensor must remain still during the calibration process. The calibration process will take approximately 1 second to complete.
