# Inertial Acceleration

Reports the acceleration value from one of the axes (x, y, or z) on the Intertial Sensor.

```don
inertial.acceleration(AxisType.XAXIS)
```

## How To Use

Acceleration of reports a range from **-4.0 to 4.0 Gs**.

Choose which axis to use:

* The **X-axis** reports acceleration when the Inertial Sensor moves **forward to backward**
* The **Y-axis** reports acceleration when the Inertial Sensor moves **side to side**
* The **Z-axis** reports acceleration when the Inertial Sensor moves **up to down**
