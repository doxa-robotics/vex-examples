description: Calibrating the Gyro Sensor is used to reduce the amount of drift generated by Gyro Sensor.

# Gyro Calibrate

Calibrate the Gyro Sensor to reduce the amount of drift generated by the Gyro Sensor.

```cpp
Gyro.calibrate(calibrationType);
```

Drifting occurs when the Gyro Sensor incorrectly detects movement even though the sensor is not moving.

## How To Use

The Gyro Sensor must remain still during the calibration process.

The `calibrationType` parameter can be replaced with any of the following options to set the calibration duration of the Gyro Sensor:
- **calNormal** will calibrate the Gyro Sensor for 2 seconds
- **calSlow** will calibrate the Gyro Sensor for 4 seconds
- **calExtended** will calibrate the Gyro Sensor for 8 seconds
