category: sensing  
signature: inertial.calibrate()
description: Gets the rate of rotation from one of the axes (x, y, or z) on the Inertial Sensor.

# Calibrate Inertial Sensor
 
Calibrating the Inertial Sensor is used to reduce the amount of drift generated by the Inertial Sensor.

```don
inertial.calibrate()
```

Drifting occurs when the Inertial Sensor incorrectly detects movement even though the sensor is not physically moving.

## How To Use

The Inertial Sensor must remain still during the calibration process. The calibration process will take approximately 2 seconds to complete.
