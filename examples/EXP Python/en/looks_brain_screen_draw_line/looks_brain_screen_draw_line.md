# Draw Line

Draws a line on the EXP Brain's screen.

```don
brain.screen.draw_line(START_X, START_Y, END_X, END_Y)
```

## How To Use

The `brain.screen.draw_line()` command requires 4 values:

* Value 1: Beginning X coordinate
* Value 2: Beginning Y coordinate
* Value 3: Ending X coordinate
* Value 4: Ending Y coordinate

The line color is determined by the `brain.screen.set_pen_color()` command. The default line color is white.
