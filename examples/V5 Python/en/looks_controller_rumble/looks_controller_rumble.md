# Rumble Controller

Triggers a vibrating effect on your V5 Controller.

```python
controller.rumble(".-.-")
```

## How To Use

The `controller.rumble(".-.-")` command uses the rumble motor in your V5 controller to provide feedback.

You can create any pattern you want using a combination of "." and "-" characters in the string. The "." character will create a short rumble. The "-" character will create a long rumble.
